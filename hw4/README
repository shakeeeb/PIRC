Describe how you implemented the main programming assignment. The README
file should describe what you did, what approach you took, results of any
measurements you made, which files are included in your submission and what
they are for, etc.  Feel free to include any other information you think is
helpful to us in this README; it can only help your grade.

Part we implemented using the execvp() call for creating new processes
from the binaries given in the PATH environment variable directories.
our builtins we didnt fork for, so our builtins are handled by the arent process, meaning that redirection or job control on builtins doesnt work, or rather wasnt implemented. Scripting support was really checking arguments that were passed in, and then subsequently executed by the progrm WERE RUNING OUTTA TIME
SORRY THANKY WILL EXPLAIN SORRY JWONG
